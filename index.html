                                        <p>Billie Castle, the Skyliners' Featured Jazz Vocalist since 1991, was born in Toledo, Ohio, into a large family brimming with musical talent. For Billie, the most 
                                            inspiring story was that of her parents, the love they shared and the jazz and big band music that served as the endearing soundtrack of the couple's sixty years 
                                            together. It was this passion that led Billie to study the works of Cole Porter, The Gershwins, Duke Ellington, and many other giants of The Great American Songbook. 
                                            Throughout her successful career, spanning four decades, Billie has been the featured vocalist for The Ed Gerlach Orchestra, The Danny Ward Orchestra, The Jimmy 
                                            Maxwell Orchestra, and The Lake Charles Jazz Orchestra. Throughout her career, Billie has been the headliner in cabaret settings as well as numerous jazz combos.</p>
