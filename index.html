                                            inspiring story was that of her parents, the love they shared and the jazz and big band music that served as the endearing soundtrack of the couple's sixty years

                                        <p>Bill Roza, the Skyliners' Pianist and Vocalist, a full-time musician, says that music
                                            has always been a huge part of his life. Bill was invited to play piano with the
                                            Skyliners in 2011 and started singing with the band when Ron Gomez retired as
                                            the male vocalist a couple years later.
                                            While taking private piano lessons as a youngster, he also played saxophone in
                                            school bands. Bill enlisted in the Army and after basic training, the Army sent him
                                            to the Navy School of Music. Upon graduation, Bill was assigned to his first Army
                                            band. During the rest of his enlistment, he played in various Army bands and
                                            spent a year in Vietnam as a bandsman and entertaining the troops. After his
                                            discharge from the Army, Bill worked in piano retail sales in Honolulu. This
                                            eventually led to him being hired by the Baldwin Piano Co. as a “product
                                            specialist” which involved training new salespeople throughout North America
                                            and Canada.
                                            Bill is probably best known locally as the &quot;one-man-band&quot; who played in
                                            Maximilian's Lounge at the Lafayette Hilton for 30 years. He is currently a regular
                                            musician at the Petroleum Club, and plays for private dance clubs, senior living
                                            communities, fund raisers and private parties. On Sundays Bill plays keyboard
                                            and sings in the Christian band at Christian Life Center Church.
                                            “It's very exciting playing piano and singing with our wonderful big band, The
                                            Skyliners. I look forward to being a member of the band for years to come.”</p>
